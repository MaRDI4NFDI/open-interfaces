# Description

This repository contains toy example that I am working on to understand
how to develop `open-interface` project within MaRDI initiative.

This toy example investigates how to connect users using Python with software
written in C and Python using a broker library in-between.


## Installation

Use `conda` or `mamba` package manager:
```shell
    mamba env create -n env-name -f environment.yaml
```
